Package Express (Branching Assignment)

This is a simple C# console application that simulates a shipping quote system for Package Express. It prompts the user to input package weight and dimensions, then calculates a shipping quote based on those values. Features

Accepts user input for:
Package weight
Package width
Package height
Package length
Validates that:
Package weight is less than or equal to 50
Total dimensions (width + height + length) are less than or equal to 50
Calculates shipping cost using the formula:
Quote = (width * height * length * weight) / 100
Displays the final quote in currency format
